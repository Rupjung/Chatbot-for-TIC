# Chatbot for Texas International College

This project is a machine learning-based chatbot designed to interact with students and visitors of Texas International College. The chatbot provides quick and helpful responses to predefined queries, enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Tokenizes and processes user input to understand queries effectively.
- **Intent Matching**: Identifies user intent from predefined categories using machine learning.
- **Custom Responses**: Provides tailored responses based on user queries.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilizes [Gradio](https://gradio.app) for a user-friendly web interface.
- **Persistence**: Caches processed data to optimize loading and training times.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NLTK**: Tokenization and text preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow & TFLearn**: Neural network for intent classification.
- **Gradio**: For creating an interactive web interface.
- **JSON**: To define intents and responses.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/texas-college-chatbot.git
   cd texas-college-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLTK Data**:
   Execute the following Python command:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

4. **Train the Model**:
   Run the `main.py` script to train the chatbot model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Launch the Interface**:
   Once the training is complete, a Gradio interface will launch, allowing you to interact with the chatbot.

## Files in the Project

- `main.py`: Main script for training and running the chatbot.
- `intents.json`: Defines the intents, patterns, and responses for the chatbot.
- `data.pickle`: Cache file storing preprocessed data.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

## Usage

Type a query in the chat interface, and the chatbot will respond based on the trained intents. Example queries include:
- "What courses do you offer?"
- "Where is Texas International College located?"

## Customization

To customize the chatbot:
1. Modify `intents.json` to add or update intents, patterns, and responses.
2. Retrain the model by re-running the `main.py` script.
